​Subject: Proposal: Pilot Implementation of Student Success & Support Ecosystem
​Dear [Academic Programme Manager’s Name],
​My name is Tshepo Napo, a first-year Computer Science student here at Varsity College Pretoria.
​I am writing to propose a supervised 6-month pilot of a platform I have developed called LearnBridge. It is a 4-tier ecosystem designed to centralize and automate the coordination of peer-tutoring, student wellness/counselling workflows, and administrative oversight.
​The system is currently a fully functional prototype built on a Firebase backend, featuring dedicated portals for:
​Students: To request and track academic support.
​Tutors: To log sessions and manage peer-support schedules.
​Counsellors: To manage wellness interventions securely.
​Administrators: To access real-time data on student engagement and support utilization.
​The Pilot Objectives:
I am looking to move this from a controlled environment into a live academic setting to:
​Verify the system’s effectiveness in improving student support accessibility.
​Gather faculty and student feedback for further technical refinement.
​Streamline the manual administrative tasks currently associated with peer-tutoring.
​Support & Implementation:
To ensure this pilot is successful and professional, I am seeking:
​Academic Supervision: I would welcome the opportunity to run this under the guidance of a faculty mentor to ensure institutional alignment.
​Institutional Permission: To test the platform within a specific department or module.
​Project Support Grant: A student innovation stipend to cover the operational costs, technical maintenance, and time required to manage the ecosystem during the 6-month period.
​I have a live demo ready and would value a 10-minute opportunity to show you the Admin Dashboard and discuss how this project can support our campus's student success goals.
​Thank you for your time and for supporting student-led innovation.
​Kind regards,
​Tshepo Napo

​Subject: Student Innovation: Proposal for a Peer-Support Pilot (LearnBridge)
​Dear [Director's Name],
​My name is Tshepo Napo. I am a first-year Computer Science student, and I am reaching out to you because I have spent my first year building a solution for a problem I see every day on campus.
​I have developed a working prototype called LearnBridge. It is a system designed to help universities manage peer-tutoring and student wellness more efficiently. I have built four separate portals (Student, Tutor, Counsellor, and Admin) using a Firebase backend.
​Why I am reaching out to Wits/UJ:
As a student developer, I know my platform is a work-in-progress. I am not looking to sell you a "perfect" corporate product. Instead, I am looking for a 6-month supervised pilot where I can:
​Deploy the system in a real-world, limited environment.
​Work under the guidance of your academic or IT staff to find bugs and improve the architecture.
​Prove that student-led innovation can solve university administrative problems.
​What I need to make this work:
To focus on this project and ensure its success, I am seeking a Student Innovation Grant/Stipend. This would allow me to cover the technical hosting costs and sustain my studies while I manage the pilot implementation.
​I would value just 10 minutes to show you what I’ve built so far. I am a student who believes in this solution, and I would love for [Wits/UJ] to be the place where it grows.
​Kind regards,
​Tshepo Napo
